mk_all
This executes mk_cross_prepare, builds the full kernel and copies everything useful to the output folder.
You should build the kernel with this.

mk_clean
Deletes the files that were created during a build

mk_mrproper
Like mk_clean but deletes more stuff. This includes the current kernel config. You may want to execute mk_defconfig or mk_customconfig afterwards.

mk_menuconfig
Open the console based kernel settings menu.

mk_customconfig
This applies the default firework_defconfig to the kernel. Make sure you have executed this once before you build the kernel or execute it before mk_menuconfig to have my configuration as a base.

mk_defconfig
This applies the samsung default configuration to the kernel.

mk_both_configs
Executes mk_defconfig and afterwards mk_menuconfig

saveconfig
Save the current .config as new firework_defconfig

mk_cross_prepare
This sets up some tools in the kernel folder for use with the cross compiler. This has to be executed after making a .config but before make all

mk_dt_img
This makes the device tree image which is part of the initrd.

mk_zImage
This makes just the kernel zImage and copies it to output/

All scripts are customizable to some extent. You can specify the number of processor cores (MAKETHREADS) used by make, change the cross compiler toolchain path (CROSS_COMPILE) and the output directory location (INSTALL_MOD_PATH).
